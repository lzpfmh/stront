# Build Guide

Actual build guide is underway, but it's very similar to [choc version](/build-guide/choc/readme.md).

## Gerber files

- [PCB](/gerbers/mx/GERBER-pcb.zip)

## Case files (3d printed)

All files are in [stl](/stl/mx) folder.

- 5mm plate for MX switches
- 2.5mm plate for KS-27/KS-33 switches
- different plate version for rotary and roller encoders. The only difference is encoder hole's size, if you're not sure, grab one with roller.
- covers

- 8mm magnets (if needed) - 2mm height

## Tools

- Soldering iron. Any iron will work, but I highly recommend something small like TS100 or Pinecil with TS-K tip, it's good for SMD soldering
- Solder, preferably with lead if you can get one. For EU I recommend this [shop](https://botland.store) and Cynel brand. 0.56mm is great for SMD, and you can optionally get 0.9mm for hotswap sockets
- [Soldering paste](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000602425410.html)
- [Flux](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004441105643.html)
- Tweezers (I prefer [reverse](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004188266714.html) instead of regular), pliers, soldering mat, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and [cotton pads](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003798227116.html) for cleaning
